    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Hello all,</p>
        <p>My name is Alejandro Romero-Reyes (Alex for short).</p> 
        <p>I’m a Web Developer looking to increase my front-end knowledge and skill.</p> 
        <p>I graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a Bachelor’s Degree of Arts in English in December 2020.</p> 
        <p>I graduated with aspirations of pursuing Technical Writing.</p> 
        <p>While looking to expand my skillset, I came across front-end development and was instantly entranced.</p>
        <p>I quickly redirected my career path and began immersing myself in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p> 
        <p>I currently focus on front-end development but am beginning to learn back-end technologies, procedures, and best practices.</p>
        <p>I’m currently available for Web and Software Development and willing to learn all that is required.</p>
        <p>Please submit a contact form or contact me directly at (831) 998-2558.</p> 
        <p>Thank you and have a great day!</p>
        <p> -Alex R.</p>
